# â–²ZEIT dashboard

The dashboard consists of some small microservices and a frontend application.
> Since the zeit API does not support CORS at the moment, all traffic is running through microservices deployed to now

All API calls point to the deployed backends below. 
> As soon as CORS is supported the backend microservices will be dropped
